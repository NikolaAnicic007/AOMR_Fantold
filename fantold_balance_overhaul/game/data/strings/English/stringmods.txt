Probably the earliest shellfish aquaculture was oysters raised in Greece about 400 BCE. The Greeks found that juvenile oysters (spat) would adhere to pottery shards spread where oysters bred. Pliny the Elder recorded mullet and bass being grown on the estates of wealthy Romans around 100 BCE. These aquaculture systems were maintained for centuries, if not millennia.\n\nGreek: Perch\n\nEgyptian: Mahi\n\nNorse: Herring\n\nAtlantean: Salmon\n\nChinese: Mahi\n"
